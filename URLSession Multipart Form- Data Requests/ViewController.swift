// Before start, i want to say that multi-part form data is not a pretty thing in Swift. if you can or if you know how i would recommend using Alamofire. only reason I would say that you should use URLSession if you want full control over your networking request like if you plan on doing something very special with your networking then this but other than this I would highly recommend using Alamofire becasuse that would be just easier as supposed to
